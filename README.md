# Twitter Clone

üöÄ Welcome to my Twitter Clone project ‚Äì a platform designed to replicate the Twitter experience with features like posting, liking, retweeting, commenting, and more.

## Purpose

üåê The main purpose of this project is to simulate the functionalities of Twitter, providing users with a social media space to express thoughts, create profiles, and share content.

## Why Build This?

üõ†Ô∏è This project serves as a showcase for my skills and knowledge, demonstrating my ability to develop a real-world application. It's a portfolio piece highlighting my proficiency in creating scalable solutions and utilizing technology effectively.

## Problem Solving

ü§î In the realm of social media, this project addresses the need for users to share ideas, create profiles, and express themselves through images and text ‚Äì solving the typical challenges faced by social media applications.

## Motivations

üí° My passion for creating things from scratch and utilizing technology to solve problems drove the development of this project. It provided valuable lessons in large-scale project planning and execution.

## About the project 

üìΩÔ∏è This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
<br /> üìÑ For commits we are using [`conventional-commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/es/v1.0.0-beta.2/).
 <br /> ‚úçüèº This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Design Solutions üé®

Take a closer look at my design solutions in Figma to get a visual sense of the project's aesthetics. I've used designs for both desktop and responsive versions to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.
