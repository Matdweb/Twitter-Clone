This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

For commits we are using [`conventional-commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/es/v1.0.0-beta.2/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## How to Contribute

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to our `'Twitter-Clone'` project! Your help is greatly appreciated. To get started, please follow these steps:

1. **Find a Ticket**: Browse our project's issues and identify a ticket you'd like to contribute to. This helps maintain a clear and organized development process.

2. **Express Your Interest**: Leave a comment on the chosen ticket with your name and a clear statement indicating your intent to contribute. This helps us track who's working on what.

3. **Ticket Assignment**: The first contributor to express interest in a ticket will be assigned to it, provided they confirm their readiness within 24 hours. This ensures efficient ticket allocation.

4. **Single Contributor per Ticket**: To ensure focused development, only one contributor may work on a ticket at a time. However, we welcome feedback and suggestions from everyone.

5. **Time Commitment**: Once a ticket is assigned to you, coordinate a suitable development timeline with the project's owner or lead developer. Please honor this commitment, as other contributors and project timelines depend on it.

6. **Code Review**: Prior to merging any code, the project owner or lead developer will review your changes to ensure alignment with project standards and objectives.

> In rare cases where guidance is extremely necessary, you can refer to the other `'Twitter-Clone'` repository to guide yourself. See [here](https://github.com/Matdweb/Twitter-Clone).

By following these steps and communicating clearly, you can make valuable contributions to our project while keeping the development process organized and collaborative. Happy coding! üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
